# [Coding Interview Prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)

If you're looking for free coding exercises to prepare for your next job interview, we've got you covered.

This section contains hundreds of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. It also has a number of take-home projects you can use to strengthen your skills, or add to your portfolio.

The Project Euler Project has been moved to it's own course. Go back to curriculum to see the list of courses we offer.

## Courses

### Algorithms

These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic and programming skills.

These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. We'll give you clear and concise explanations of how these different algorithms work so you can implement a solution for each one.
